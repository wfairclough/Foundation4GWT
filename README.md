# Welcome to Foundation4GWT

A GWT Library that provides the widgets of Zurb Foundation. 

I wanted to create a easy way to use the Zurb Foundation front-end framework in my GWT projects. The goal of this project is to just inherit this GWT module and start using all the awesome Foundation widgets with the clean simple look Foundation brings.
